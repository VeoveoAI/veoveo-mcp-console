//! The template server's library. The `contract` feature holds the server's public
//! types; the default `server` feature adds the hosted server, which keeps each tenant's
//! items in the `template` schema and serves them over MCP through the SDK. The domain
//! is the smallest that exercises a tool with a product, an exact read and a keyset
//! listing, so a new server starts from code that passes the contract and database
//! checks.
